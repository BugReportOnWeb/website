> "The shine in the eyes comes with a hope for it to glow in the dark. I just couln't see it clearly"

It's a little weird how I have not yet written a single blog that involves any tech whatsoever, but I just can't put on a mask. I didn't knew this would turn into a journey of sharing than learning but here we are now.

The passenger we have along does makes you choose a turn, and it was meant to be the way it was. The choices you have, the actions you take, will somehow shape into another unexplored road for you to enjoy when it all settles down. That's how I came across a turn. One that shaped me as well. One that made me learn and understand. It was rough, but needed, it was there for me to have it.

### Sunrise  (Start)
Either you spread your wings, give them a chance and take a marvelous flight of your life, or you can chip them away, keep them intact and break yourself apart. The choice sounds simpler than it really is. I couldn't see what was it all for, losing myself in there, not able to find a path. The actions were obvious, yet they weren't, the words were generous, yet burned.

It was a pendulum of rays that made it all difficult to put a line arcoss it. The people we have close can see it all, and it makes it even more hard to have a hand on one side. You live for the skies, you get away with the lies, yet couldn't understand when the stability too flies. Going by thought of leaving the ground just to see how it feels to catch the lost dream out there in wild.

The time felt like the last days of spring. As the heat got high on us, the temprature started to rise too, but just for me, not for you. It was short, but the details had an impact to a depth. I never knew that these feathers would grow into a hope to try. Those felt near for the first, even more for the second, but the when the beauty subsides, you get head the tear of pages right in front of you.
