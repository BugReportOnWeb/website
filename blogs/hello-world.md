What could be a better way to greet you all? Welcome to my first blog! This is where it all starts, probably would end somewhere down the line, can\'t see, can\'t take into notice, but whenever it may be, it\'s sure to be a blast! ;)

As this is my very first blog, I\'ll try to keep it short. Some of the things I\'d like to discuss are what you can expect from these blogs and what else I have in my mind for the curve to take a shape as it goes.

### Is there a specific genre? 

Even though I\'m a techie, It surely isn\'t a tech all-around pitstop, but rather a place for me to express myself and share my thoughts. No worries, I won\'t keep on with the rants, but focus more onto clearing and sharing something that I would like to have engraved on the girthy wires of the internet. Does that sound like something one should be more concerned about? It certainly does to me as I write this, but there\'s no turning back now.

While I say it's not all tech, it doesn\'t mean that it has 0% hold of the stake. In fact the very next blog or the one after that will likely be tech-related. So yeah, it\'s all what I would like to share, regardless of the genre.

### Sounds like journaling, doesn't it?

Saying all this does make it lowkey related to journaling, but I guess it isn\'t, believe me, I don\'t lie that often unless it\'s the only choice in hand. It\'s just a medium to share things with you all. I have no idea who you all could be, but if it\'s just me, I\'m sure he\'s gonna have a good time revisiting the bend in the new arc again :)

Other than that, maybe I\'d like to have a special place for all of them. Who are 'them' you ask? Well, it's just a matter of time before I open that vault and let it out. But let me warn you! Take my words with a grain of salt. I'm too laz... I mean "busy" to implement new features in here, and that should be evident to those who already know me :p

### Now what?

If I knew the answer to that, it wouldn\'t have taken me ages to get to this threshold that could have been a day\'s long journey. Yes, that\'s ME, hurray! \**sobs in the corner*\* But yeah it\'s gonna be a way to a new call, one that has been poking me for a long time. At least that would be something to keep by the side instead of letting it slip away, as I often do.

The steps are unknown, but so is life, isn\'t it? Maybe it would turn itself into an enormous blacked out machine, or perhaps just a relatively modest mini by the end. But both are fine in my opinion, as long as it functions as intended. Did you get all of that? I can already see it go...

&nbsp;

So, that\'s all for now I guess. Writing all of this was fun, and I hope to not destroy this way before I could have a chance to be greeted by the curtains itself! Come one guys, you know it all, there\'s no need to downplay it this early ;) On that note, I\'ll end my talk here. Until next time. Cheers!
