Even in his pain, he did let me know,\
That there was one thing left behind.\
A reason for pride and movement,\
But it never crossed my mind.

<br />

I was there, stunned, couldn't think,\
Couldn't even have a sense of time.\
But the waves sank in, rushed through me,\
Enduring it all while making me shine.

<br />

Just as I took the space, never letting it go,\
Only to remain silent as it all flowed,\
Because he was in pain, and still let me know.

<br />

As things settled down,\
And time went by,\
Heat took hold of the mind,\
And the senses started to fly.

<br />

That's when it assembled gracefully\
And gave an elegant cause.\
Just to be oblivious when needed,\
He showed me who I was.

<br />

PS: I don't write poems, but felt the need on this one.
