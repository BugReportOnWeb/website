# Personal Website

I'm not sure what else you'd be looking for in the project docs besides the source (for curiosity?). There isn't much to give away here in terms of 'How to use this software?'. All it is, is my personal website I built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) because it was fun for me and I wanted a space for myself on the web.

## Local Setup

To test the website locally on your machine, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BugReportOnWeb/website.git
cd website
```

- Start the Next.js development server:
```bash
npm install       # Install project dependencies
npm run dev       # Start the local server
```

The development server will be available at localhost:3000.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute anything to the site, whether it's a new feature, a bug fix, or even just a small typo correction, feel free to open a PR. Additionally, if you have any suggestions, improvement tips, or anything that could benefit the project, you are welcome to let me know through any of my [contact](https://devkaul.vercel.app/contact) methods.
